# Fine-Grained Code Analysis for Processor Fuzzing

## Overview

This project improves processor fuzzing by flattening RTL designs and performing static analysis to extract **control flow graphs (CFGs)** and basic block dependencies. Using this control flow information accelerates coverage convergence and helps generate tests that reach edge cases more efficiently.

---

## Workflow

1. **RTL Flattening**: Transforms hierarchical RTL into a flat Verilog file  
2. **Static Analysis**: Symbolically analyzes the flattened RTL to extract CFG and dependencies  
3. **Fuzzing Loop**: Uses control flow information to guide efficient test generation

## Directory Structure

- **Benchmark/Verilog/**  
  - `BoomTile_noCFG.v`, `RocketTile_noCFG.v`: Flattened Verilog generated by our tool  
  - `BoomTile_CFG.v`, `RocketTile_CFG.v`: Verilog after symbolization and static analysis  
- **CFG/**  
  - Contains exported control flow graphs (see `.txt` files for details)  
- **Fuzzer/**  
  - Core fuzzing and test generation scripts

## How to Run

Run the following command:

```bash
./start_fuzzing_[rocket or boom].sh [batch index] [number of iterations]
```
Example: ./start_fuzzing_rocket.sh 0 10000
